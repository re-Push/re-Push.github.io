# Impressions
- It was interesting to be able to scrap various data on the Internet.
- It was interesting that there are not only SQL but also NoSQL methods for storing data.

# What can I do to improve?
- I want to try taking various websites and making them my own organized pages.
- It would be good to know how the NoSQL storage method works in detail.

# Below is the code of the webpage I made.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

headers = {'User-Agent' : 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.86 Safari/537.36'}
data = requests.get('https://www.genie.co.kr/chart/top200',headers=headers)

soup = BeautifulSoup(data.text, 'html.parser')

trs = soup.select('#body-content > div.newest-list > div > table > tbody > tr')

for tr in trs:
    title = tr.select_one('td.info > a.title.ellipsis').text.strip()
    rank = tr.select_one('td.number').text[0:2].strip()
    artist = tr.select_one('td.info > a.artist.ellipsis').text
    print(rank, title, artist)
```
